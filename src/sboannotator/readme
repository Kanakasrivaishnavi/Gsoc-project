 Overview

  Enhanced version of SBOannotator that adds unified database adapter functionality to improve EC number annotation coverage by querying multiple biological databases.

  Key Differences

  1. adapter.py (New File)

  Purpose: Implements adapter pattern for querying biological databases to obtain EC numbers.

  Key Components:
  - EnzymeDataAdapter: Abstract base class defining the adapter interface
  - KEGGAdapter: Queries KEGG REST API for EC numbers using reaction IDs
  - BiGGAdapter: Queries BiGG universal reactions database
  - UnifiedEnzymeDataProvider: Coordinates all adapters and deduplicates results
  - callForECAnnotRxnUnified(): Main function that integrates with original SBOannotator

  2. SBOannotatorEnhancedClass.py vs SBOannotator.py

  Single Key Difference: Line 94 replaces the original logic with:
  callForECAnnotRxnUnified(reaction)  # Enhanced: query multiple databases

  Functionality:  the enhanced version queries BiGG and KEGG APIs to find EC numbers, then applies appropriate SBO terms.

  3. main.py Modifications

  Changes:
  - Runs both original and enhanced annotation workflows on the same model
  - Compares results between the two approaches
  - Shows performance timing for both methods

  How to Run

  cd /Users/lareinahu/Documents/2025_gsoc/SBOannotator/SBOannotator/src/sboannotator
  python __main__.py

  Requirements:
  - Internet connection (for API calls to BiGG and KEGG)
  - requests, tqdm, libsbml packages

  Expected Results

  1. First Round (Original SBOannotator)

  - Displays SBO term statistics before annotation
  - Shows SBO term counts after original annotation
  - Lists reactions that remain unannotated
  - Reports execution time

  2. Second Round (Enhanced SBOannotator)

  - Runs enhanced version with API-based EC number lookup
  - Displays final SBO term statistics
  - Reports enhanced version execution time

  3. Output Files

  - RECON1_SBOannotated.xml: Annotated SBML model saved to ../../models/Annotated_Models/

  4. Performance Comparison

  - Time comparison between original and enhanced versions
  - More reaction would be set to sbo: 0000176 using enhanced way




  The enhanced system provides better metabolic reaction annotation by leveraging multiple biological databases when direct EC annotations are unavailable.
